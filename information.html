									<h3>An Overview of my plans </h3>
									<p>In this section, you will find a resume and my outlook for my future career.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Having graduated from Georgia Tech with high honors and a degree in Computer Engineering in December 2023, I’ve spent the past 
									1.5 years honing my skills in Data Analytics. This experience has not only solidified my technical expertise 
									but also fueled my passion for data-driven solutions and innovative problem-solving. As I continue to grow in my career,
									 I’m eager to transition into a role where I can further expand my impact by tackling complex challenges 
									 and driving meaningful insights.
									 I remain committed to lifelong learning and staying at the forefront of my field. In addition to my professional work, 
									 I actively engage in personal projects and research to explore new technologies and sharpen my skillset.
									  My long-term goal is to evolve into a career as a Data Engineer, leveraging my technical foundation and 
									  passion for data to build efficient, scalable systems. 
									  Outside of work, I balance my professional ambitions with hobbies that keep me inspired and grounded. 
									  I enjoy woodworking, channeling my creativity into crafting functional and aesthetically pleasing pieces. 
									  I’m also fascinated by networks, particularly home networks and IoT, where I dive into the complexities of how 
									  systems connect and communicate. When I’m not exploring tech or working on personal projects, you’ll likely 
									  find me playing volleyball or pickleball to keep me active and help me unwind.
